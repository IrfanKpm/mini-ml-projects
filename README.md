# Mini ML Projects

Welcome to the Mini ML Projects repository! This repository contains various small-scale machine learning projects that I've worked on during my learning journey. Each project showcases different machine learning techniques and provides practical insights into the field.

## Projects

### 1. [Spam Classifier](https://github.com/IrfanKpm/mini-ml-projects/tree/main/spam-message-classification)
 
A spam classifier project using Logistic Regression and TF-IDF Vectorizer. The model is trained to classify emails as either "spam" or "ham".

### 2. [Heart Disease Prediction](https://github.com/IrfanKpm/mini-ml-projects/tree/main/heart-disease-prediction)
  
This project utilizes a logistic regression model to predict heart disease based on various medical features. It includes scripts for training the model and making predictions on new data.

### 3. [Breast Cancer Classification](https://github.com/IrfanKpm/mini-ml-projects/tree/main/breast-cancer-classification)

This project uses a Logistic Regression model to classify breast cancer as either benign or malignant based on input features derived from the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. It includes scripts for training the model, making predictions, and visualizing the results.
